The purpose of the project implementation plan is to do object detection on SVHN dataset. <br />
I used Retinanet[(Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002)<br />
This project is mainly base on [penny4860's previous work](https://github.com/penny4860/retinanet-digit-detector).<br />
